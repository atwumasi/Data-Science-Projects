# Building-a-Robust-Recommendation-System
Applying various NLP techniques to build a robust recommendation engine
## **Title : Building & Deploying Real World Movie Recommendation Systems**

Demo

## **Problem Statement:**

In the era of digital streaming, viewers are inundated with countless movie choices across various platforms. This often leads to decision fatigue, where users struggle to choose what to watch next. A personalized movie recommendation system is needed to help users discover movies that align with their preferences. Furthermore, integrating a user authentication system will allow for personalized experiences, where recommendations and preferences are saved for each individual user.

This project aims to develop a comprehensive Movie Recommendation System that offers personalized movie recommendations using both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. The system will also include a user authentication feature that allows users to log in, register, and access personalized recommendations based on their unique preferences.

## **Key Features:**

**Movie Recommendation System**:

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to the ones a user has liked based on genres, descriptions, and other movie metadata.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies based on what other users with similar tastes have liked.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering to improve recommendation accuracy.
1. **User Authentication System**:
- **Login/Registration**: Users can create an account or log in to an existing account to access personalized recommendations.
- **Session Management**: Tracks user sessions to ensure that each user’s data and preferences are kept separate and secure.

**Movie Details Page**:

- **Genre Display**: Shows movie genres in a clean, user-friendly format.
- **Top Billed Cast**: Displays headshots and names of top cast members.
- **Trailer Integration**: Includes a movie trailer in the background for an immersive experience.

**Search and Discovery**:

- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for specific movies.
- **Trending Movies**: Displays currently popular movies.
- **Top 10 Movies**: Lists the top 10 movies in the user’s region.

**User Interface**:

- **Dynamic and Responsive Design**: Ensures that the application is user-friendly and accessible across different devices.

## **Software and Tools Used:**

**Programming Language**:

- Python: Core programming language used for backend development.

**Web Framework**:

- Flask: Lightweight web framework used to develop the backend of the application, manage routes, and handle server requests.

**Database Management**:

- SQLite (or an alternative database system): Used to store user credentials, movie data, and user preferences.

**API Integration**:

- TMDb API: Fetches movie data, including details, ratings, and recommendations.

**Machine Learning Libraries**:

- Scikit-Learn: Used for implementing content-based and collaborative filtering models.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Pickle: For saving and loading machine learning models.

**Frontend Technologies**:

- HTML/CSS: Used for designing the layout and styling of the web pages.
- JavaScript: Provides dynamic functionalities like search suggestions and page interactions.
- Bootstrap (optional): To ensure responsive design and consistency across different devices.

## **Techniques Applied:**

**Content-Based Filtering**:

- Uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to recommend movies based on the content.

**Collaborative Filtering**:

- Employs K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to recommend movies based on user behavior and similarities between users.

**Hybrid Recommendation System**:

- Combines the strengths of content-based and collaborative filtering to provide more accurate recommendations.

**User Authentication and Session Management**:

- Implements secure login and registration functionalities to personalize the user experience.
